      Please find attached reads like annoying office jargon, so you might
      wonder whether it’s necessary in an email. The simple answer is no, you do
      not. First, this phrase is inane, dated and overly formal. You want to
      keep a natural tone with your recipients – not sound like a character from
      a George Elliott novel. Second, this phrase is not even proper grammar.
      There is no reason to make “attached” an adjective when it’s a verb. A
      clearer, modern alternative might be: “I’m sharing [item] with you.”
      Third, this phrase is redundant. Your attachment will show up in the
      email, so there is no need to announce its existence.our attachment will
      show up in the email, so there is no need to announce its existence.our
